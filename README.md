## This project is DEPRECATED and no longer maintained

This was the repository for my personal website [Bugfree](http://www.bugfree.fi).

## Old description

It is running on Node.js/Express and uses Pug template language. It uses PostgreSQL as the database management system, [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) for deployment and [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) for CI.

## Deployment

Deployment is done using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com). Prerequisites:

- Ubuntu Server 16.10
- PostgreSQL 9.6 with database 'bugfree'
- Redis server
- ssh connection
- no ssh passphrase
- no sudo password

First create a configuration file `ansible/hosts.yaml` using `ansible/hosts-template.yaml` as a template. The actual deployment:

```shell
npm run deploy
```

## Roadmap

These are the features I'm planning to implement (in no order of importance):

- simple CMS for publishing articles or blog entries
- separate frontend
- implement frontend in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org)
- improved repository structure
